# Release System

The release workflows for this template are now maintained in the centralized repository `Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python`. This project consumes those reusable workflows for production, validation, and staging releases while keeping only minimal configuration locally.

## Release workflows

### Production release (`release.yml`)
[![Release](https://github.com/Chisanan232/Template-Python-UV-Project/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/Template-Python-UV-Project/actions/workflows/release.yml)

Publishes production artifacts (PyPI package, container images, docs) using the centralized `rw_release_complete.yaml` workflow logic.

:::note Documentation
See the reusable workflow guide for production releases: [rw_release_complete.yaml](https://chisanan232.github.io/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/docs/next/workflows/release/rw_release_complete) (hosted in `Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python`).
:::

### Release staging (`release-staging.yml`)
[![Release Staging](https://github.com/Chisanan232/Template-Python-UV-Project/actions/workflows/release-staging.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/Template-Python-UV-Project/actions/workflows/release-staging.yml)

Creates staging/TestPyPI packages, RC container images, and preview documentation to test releases before production.

:::note Documentation
Reusable staging workflow reference: [rw_release_staging_complete.yaml](https://chisanan232.github.io/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/docs/next/workflows/release/rw_release_staging_complete).
:::

### Release validation (`release-validate.yml`)
[![Release Validation](https://github.com/Chisanan232/Template-Python-UV-Project/actions/workflows/release-validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Chisanan232/Template-Python-UV-Project/actions/workflows/release-validate.yml)

Dry-runs the release pipeline for pull requests, verifying builds and security checks without publishing artifacts.

## Overview

- **Centralized logic**: All release orchestration lives in the reusable workflow repository.
- **Multi-target support**: Python packages, container images, and documentation publishing remain available through the shared workflows.
- **Configuration-driven**: Child projects configure releases via `intent.yaml`, delegating implementation details to the centralized workflows.
- **Release targets at a glance**:
  - PyPI for production Python packages
  - TestPyPI for staging/validation builds
  - Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry for container images
  - Docusaurus documentation deployments

## Working in this template

- Maintain `intent.yaml` to control release behavior for this project.
- Ensure workflow references point to the centralized repository (for example, `uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_release_complete.yaml@main`).
- Use the linked documentation for detailed steps, troubleshooting, and advanced configuration.
