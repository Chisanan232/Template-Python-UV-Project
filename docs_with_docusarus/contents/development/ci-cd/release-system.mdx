# Release System

The release workflows for this template are now maintained in the centralized repository `Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python`. This project consumes those reusable workflows for production, validation, and staging releases while keeping only minimal configuration locally.

## Overview

- **Centralized logic**: All release orchestration lives in the reusable workflow repository.
- **Multi-target support**: Python packages, container images, and documentation publishing remain available through the shared workflows.
- **Configuration-driven**: Child projects configure releases via `intent.yaml`, delegating implementation details to the centralized workflows.
- **Release targets at a glance**:
  - PyPI for production Python packages
  - TestPyPI for staging/validation builds
  - Docker Hub and GitHub Container Registry for container images
  - Docusaurus documentation deployments

## Working in this template

- Maintain `intent.yaml` to control release behavior for this project.
- Ensure workflow references point to the centralized repository (for example, `uses: Chisanan232/GitHub-Action_Reusable_Workflows-Python/.github/workflows/rw_release_complete.yaml@main`).
- Use the linked documentation for detailed steps, troubleshooting, and advanced configuration.
